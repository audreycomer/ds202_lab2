```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
```

**Question Set (Individual)**

```{r}
#1
hist(choco$Rating, ylim = c(0,700))
```

This histogram displays that the ratings of chocolate are typically between 2.5 and 3.75. There are several outliers with ratings of 1-2 or 5.

```{r}
#2
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```

Based on this scatterplot, there is little to no linear pattern. In other words, the data points (or individual chocolate ratings) are randomly dispersed, representing a low correlation.
